# Godot art pipeline investigations #1

Asked in the Godot discord about how people were doing the Godot 3.0 3d art import workflow.

I was trying to import assets from sketchfab (gltf2 format) and a lot of the work was fixing textures - material mappings

Steps:

* Disable ect2 compression in Godot 3 Editor.
* Convert from FBX using
https://github.com/pissang/qtek-model-viewer - 3D model viewer with high quality rendering
* Import gltf2
* Fix material mapping

I have been investigating godot. It's a 3d game engine that has support for physically based rendering.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
